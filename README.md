Its have just a few steps :

#### Benifits:

1. Data binding can lead to faster development times
2. Faster execution times (more then findviewbyid)
3. Stronger readability (More readable and maintained code).
4. Remove boilerplate code

#### Drawback :

1. Auto generated class (it's true it will increase the app size)
2. Hard to debug - depends, like readability, of what you are used to.


#### Add the dataBinding element to your app build.gradle file to enable Data Binding.
      android {
      dataBinding.enabled = true
      }
